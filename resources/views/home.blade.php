    <h1>Life<br />Problems</h1>
    <p>
      You may be going through a new phase in your life, or having problems
      with a close relationship, or you just want to simply problem-solve a

      who is outside of your circle of friends and family who can give you
      an objective.

      A counsellor can help you understand why you feel stressed and find
      strategies that can help you learn how to cope with stress. â€œTalking

      when we're stressed, and why.
